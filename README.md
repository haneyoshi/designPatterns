implement diverse design patterns to create applications


RemoteControl:
This program employs the Command Pattern to simulate a remote controller, encapsulating actions into objects for a dynamic and versatile experience.

Simplified Mario game:
By implementing factory pattern, based on the chosen settings(game world and difficulty level, in this case), the game generates(instantiates) the corresponding enemies(classes).

StorageAlgorithm:
The program simulates a storage algorithm, that objects(file/folder) are composed into a tree structure, by implementing Composite and Visitor Pattern.
