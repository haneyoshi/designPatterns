Every folder has an instruction provides the detail of how the program implements. Here is to briefly explain those programs meant to do.

** A3 **

PartA:
By applying Command Pattern, the program simulates a remote controller(RemoteControlAPP), which the remote does not have the specifics of the vendor classes(the objects actually perform the action). Instead, a request of an action is encapsulated into an object. 

PartB:
By applying Singleton and Template Method, the program simulates a simplified Mario game where defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method and deferring some steps to subclasses(let the subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm) without changing the algorithm structure.

** A4 **

By implementing Composite and Visitor Pattern, the program simulates a storage algorithm that objects(file/folder) are composed into a tree structure. Then add additional operations(backup/search).
